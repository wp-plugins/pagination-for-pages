Easily create pagination type navigation between pages (or any other custom post type)

== Description ==

**Pagination for Pages** is a very simple plugin that creates navigation between pages (or any other custom post type) with the same parent.

This plugin gives you one new function, `pagination_for_pages($getPagesQuery='sort_column=menu_order&sort_order=asc')`

1. **getPagesQuery** - Passed directly to [get_pages](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_pages), read the codex to find all available options. Defaults to menu_order ascending & pages.
